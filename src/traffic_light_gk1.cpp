/*
The Traffic Light Controlled Intersection:
 The problem describes a traffic light at an intersection of two roads, Road A
and Road B. Initially, Road A has a green light, allowing cars on Road A to
pass, while Road B has a red light, so cars on Road B wait. The traffic light
controller needs to:
  - Allow cars on the green road to pass without interruption.
  - Switch the green light between Road A and Road B when requested, ensuring
thread safety. The solution must implement a TrafficLight class with: void
carArrived(int carId, int roadId, int direction, function<void()> turnGreen,
function<void()> goThrough): carId: Unique car identifier (1 to 1000). roadId: 1
for Road A, 2 for Road B. direction: 1 for left, 2 for right (not directly
relevant to traffic light logic). turnGreen: Function to make the carâ€™s road
green. goThrough: Function to let the car pass the intersection. The system must
be thread-safe, as multiple cars (threads) may call carArrived concurrently.
